					Hello, everyone! I am currently looking for a chess coach who can help me improve my chess skills. I am very interested in playing right now
					since I think it is a very fun game, but mostly because I want to beat my friend who keeps on winning against me.

					To compensate for your time and energy, I will be paying you 100 dollars per session. I'll pay you 500 dollars now. If I somehow won against 
					him in the next 3 months of our sessions, I will pay you double. If I still lose, I will not be paying you. Comment down below if you are interested!

					Also, I want our sessions to be face-to-face since I don't like discord or zoom. I heard there are multiple ranks in chess, so if possible, I want you
					to also message your ranks. Don't worry, I won't judge you since I am a newbie myself. Thank you. (Please don't downvote me)
